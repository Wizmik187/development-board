Boards produced by libmcu are divided into core boards and extension boards.

Several types of core boards are manufactured in the same form factor,
30x21.59mm long. Because data communication and debugger connection are
possible through the Type-C USB port of the core board, the core board by
itself can fully play the role of a development board.

Extention board is a board to which various sensors and functions are added.
A suitable core board can be attached/detached to the extension board.

For specifications, please refer to [the developer
documentation](https://docs.libmcu.org/boards/index.html).
[SDK](https://github.com/libmcu/MADI) and [getting started
guide](https://docs.libmcu.org/quickstart/index.html) are for you to get
started easily.

## Core Boards
Currently, there are three types of core boards using
[ESP32S3](https://docs.libmcu.org/boards/esp32.html#esp32-libmcu),
[STM32G4](https://docs.libmcu.org/boards/stm32.html#stm32-libmcu), and
[nRF52840](https://docs.libmcu.org/boards/nrf52.html#nrf52-libmcu).

## Extension Boards
Working on it.
